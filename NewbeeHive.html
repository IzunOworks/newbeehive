# NewbeeHive

**NewbeeHive** is an **experimental guideline**  
designed to make it easier for beginners to ask questions.

It is not a service, a forum, or a community.  
It simply proposes a way to ask questions  
using platforms that already exist.

---

## What is NewbeeHive?

NewbeeHive is a **lightweight rule set**  
for asking questions without fear of being ignored,  
nitpicked, or corrected in excessive detail.

Instead of creating a new Q&A site or social network,  
NewbeeHive suggests  
**simpler ways to use existing platforms**.

The goal is not to get perfect answers.  
The goal is to make **asking questions itself feel easier**.

---

## What NewbeeHive does NOT aim to be

NewbeeHive does not aim to be:

- A permanent knowledge base
- A moderated community
- A place to judge the quality of questions
- A system that ranks people or answers

In NewbeeHive, questions may be:

- Incomplete
- Vague
- Incorrect
- Temporary

And that is acceptable.

---

## How to use NewbeeHive

### Step 1: Use any platform you like

X (Twitter), forums, blogs, or anywhere else  
**where people can read your post**.

NewbeeHive itself does not provide a place to ask questions.

---

### Step 2: Use a simple question template

A NewbeeHive-style question only needs three things:

- What you want to do
- What you tried
- What didn’t work (or what you don’t understand)

Precise technical terms are **not required**.

---

### Step 3: Add the `#NewbeeHive` tag

When you post a question or share your thoughts,  
add the **`#NewbeeHive`** hashtag.

This tag acts as a **loose marker**  
to make NewbeeHive-style posts easier to find.

---

### Step 4: Search with `#NewbeeHive`

When you want to find questions or ideas from others,  
search for **`#NewbeeHive`**.

You may find:
- People stuck in similar situations
- Explanations from those at a similar level
- Imperfect but useful thought processes

---

### Step 5: Do not expect permanence

Answers may disappear.  
Links may break.  
That is fine.

If something matters to you,  
**save it yourself**.

---

## Learning by teaching

NewbeeHive is not only for people who ask questions.

Answering questions is also considered  
**part of the learning process**.

- You do not need to be an expert
- You do not need to be correct

Answers like these are welcome:

- “I’m not completely sure, but this is how I understand it”
- “I might be wrong, but this worked for me”
- “I was stuck at the same point”

Trying to explain your understanding in your own words  
can help deepen that understanding.

---

## Status

NewbeeHive is an  
**experimental guideline**.

It may change.  
It may remain small.  
You do not need permission to use it.

If it is useful, use it.  
If not, feel free to ignore it.
